    This document presents a comprehensive review of decentralized solution methods for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. These problems are essential in various fields due to their ability to model complex decision-making scenarios, characterized by linear relationships involving both continuous and integer variables. The review begins with a general problem formulation and an explanation of the centralized solution approach. It then explores the evolution of decentralized solutions, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. A case study on the decentralized control of the charging process for a large fleet of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in a smart grid environment is provided to illustrate practical applications. The case study uses the solution method proposed by Manieri et al. (2023), demonstrating the practical implications and challenges of decentralized solution methods in real-world settings.
