\subsection{Centralized approach}
Figure \ref{fig:cen_power} shows the power profile of the PEVs in the centralized approach. The aggregated power tracks almost perfectly the reference value, without ever exceeding the constraint on the maximum power.

The state of charge evolution of a random batch of 10 PEVs can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:cen_state}. The state of charge is kept within the limits and the final values reflect the desired ones.

Finding the optimal solution of the centralized problem takes about $414.3\,s \simeq 7\,min $. This is typically not acceptable in a real-world scenario, where the optimization problem should be solved in a significantly shorter time than the duration of the sampling step.
